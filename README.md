# PP
PP stands for "Personal Projects". This repository is my personal codebase for all my personal projects such as web/mobile development, data science, etc. So this codebase will include couple of technologies that I usually use such as JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Python, Java, Kafka, Redis, and many more. Feel free to explore my projects :).
